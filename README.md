Interactive Photo Gallery

Are you ready to have your project reviewed by a fellow Techdegree student? Before you submit your project, make sure you have double-checked your work, we want you to pass the first time!

If you get your project back and it needs work, you’ll have to wait 1 day before you can resubmit your project.

Instructions
How you'll be graded
In this project, you will create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos will be provided with descriptions.

At the top of the page you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous buttons to cycle through photos.

NOTE: The Front End Web Development Techdegree is meant to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In addition, please avoid submitting any projects that rely on a server-side technology like PHP or Ruby on Rails.

Before you start

To prepare for this project you'll need to make sure you complete and understand these steps.

 2 steps
Have a GitHub account and know how to create a new repository and upload files to it.
As with the previous projects, you'll submit your finished working project using GitHub.
If you need a reminder on how to use GitHub and GitHub desktop to create a new repository check out this Workshop 'Share Your Projects With GitHub Desktop' in the Project Resources.

Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

 8 steps
Create a web page using HTML and CSS. The page should have a title, a search box, and a place where a photo gallery will be placed.
Add the provided images to the gallery using the design in the gallery_mockup.png file.
The numbers and dotted lines in the mockup provide size information to help you build the project -- don't include them in your final design.
Find a jQuery plugin for creating a photo gallery or write your own script.
The gallery must include the ability to click on photos and view them in a lightbox (see the photo_lightbox.png file for the design).
Add text captions to the images when viewed in the lightbox.
See the photo_lightbox.png file for the design.
Add back and forward buttons when the lightbox is visible to switch between photos.
Implement the search box at the top of the page that filters photos based on the captions.
The photos should filter in real-time as you type.
This could be a jQuery plugin that you find on the web, or code that you write yourself.
Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:
Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored.
If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.
You should also check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, linked in the Project Resources.
JSHint may show you some warnings, so make sure to check through those for any potential problems.
You do not need to fix every warning listed but reviewing them can be useful.
NOTE: A good practice is to check your project for cross browser compatibility. Making sure that it looks and functions correctly in multiple (at least three) browsers is an important part of being a top-notch developer. If you want, leave a comment to the project reviewer about which browser(s) the project was checked to ensure they are seeing things as you have designed them.
Some browser options:
Google Chrome
Mozilla Firefox
